\section{Descriptors and pairing}
In computer vision, a descriptor is understood as a numerical representation, generally vectorial, that is used for the summarized representation in features of the neighborhood of an entity in an image, which is specifically conceived in order to be able to perform matching or comparison operations of those same entities with other images even when there are events such as changes of scale, rotations, illuminations, or noise that can interfere with the normal matching process; a descriptor can then be understood, therefore, as the result of mapping into a vector a local neighborhood in an image, guaranteeing robustness understood as stability under image changes, viewpoints, geometric distortion and occlusions, the discrimination of different objects given the vector, and efficiency, in such a way that it will be easy to compute and compact in memory, that is, it is a feature vector corresponding to the key points.
